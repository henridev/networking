### Host Roles

This topic discusses the parts of a network.

**hosts** = All computers that are connected to a network and participate directly in network communication. Hosts can be called **end devices** others **clients**. the term hosts specifically refers to devices on the network that are assigned *a number for communication purposes* (= **Internet Protocol (IP) address**) (it identifies a host within network). 

**Internet Protocol (IP) address** = identifies the host and the network to which the host is attached.

**Servers** = computers with software that allow them to provide information, like email or web pages, to other end devices on the network. 

> Each service requires separate server software. For example, a server requires web server software in order to provide web services to the network. A computer with server software can provide services simultaneously to many different clients.

**clients** = *type of host*. Clients have software for requesting and displaying the information obtained from the server

### Peer-to-peer

**peer-to-peer network** = computers function as the servers and clients on the network. **Client** and **server** software => usually run on separate computers, but it is also possible for one computer to be used for both roles at the same time. In small businesses and homes, many 

### end-to-end devices

The network devices that people are most familiar with are end devices. To distinguish one end device from another, *each end device on a network has an address*. When an end device initiates communication, it uses the address of the destination end device to specify where to deliver the message.

An end device is *either the source or destination of a message transmitted over the network.*

### intermediary devices

**Intermediary devices** 

- connect the individual end devices to the network. 
- They can connect multiple individual networks to form an **internetwork**. -
- provide connectivity and ensure that data flows across the network.

Intermediary devices use the destination end device **address**, in conjunction with information about the network **interconnections**, to determine the path that messages should take through the network. 


### network media

**media** = provides the channel over which the message travels from source to destination in a network.

Modern networks primarily use three types of media to interconnect devices

- Metal wires within cables - Data is encoded into electrical impulses.
- Glass or plastic fibers within cables (fiber-optic cable) - Data is encoded into pulses of light.
- Wireless transmission - Data is encoded via modulation of specific frequencies of electromagnetic waves.


## 1.3 Network Representations and Topologies

terminology to describe how these devices and media connect to eachother

- **NIC (network interface card)** = phsically connects *end-device* to *network*
- **Physical Port** = connector/outlet on *networking device* where *media* connects to an *end-device* or another *networking device*
- **Interface** = specialized ports *on networking device* connecting to *individual networks*. because routers connect networks, the port on it is often referred to as *network interface*

> terms port and interface are often interchangeably used

### Topology Diagrams

Topology diagrams are mandatory documentation for anyone working with a network. They provide a visual map of how the network is connected. There are two types of topology diagrams: physical and logical.

- Physical Topology Diagrams = illustrate the physical location of intermediary devices and cable installation, as shown in the figure. 
- Logical topology diagrams = illustrate devices, ports, and the addressing scheme of the network.


## 1.4 Comon Types of Networks

### diferent sizes

- Small Home Networks – connect a few computers to each other and the Internet
- Small Office/Home Office – enables computer within a home or remote office to connect to a corporate network
- Medium to Large Networks – many locations with hundreds or thousands of interconnected computers
- World Wide Networks – connects hundreds of millions of computers world-wide – such as the internet
